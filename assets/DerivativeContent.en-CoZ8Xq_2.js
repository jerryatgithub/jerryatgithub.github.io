Through AI character interaction and personalized settings, we aim to inspire creativity and imagination. These guidelines are designed to help you create with confidence while ensuring all content is shared respectfully and lawfully. </p><h2>1. What is a Creation?</h2><p> &quot;Creation&quot; refers to creative works derived from content generated by the FLAI App, processed and developed through the user&#39;s own ideas. Examples include: </p><p>(1) AI character profiles and dream submissions made using the template feature;</p><p> (2) Screenshots or screen recordings of AI conversations, adapted into scripts, comics, novels, voice dramas, or videos; </p><p> (3) Voice content created via the voice feature, including vocal covers, remixes, or songs. </p><p> Works that involve only basic manipulation (e.g., copying) without original input or that involve plagiarism are not considered &quot;Creation&quot; under these guidelines. </p><h2>2.
